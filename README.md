# Build on Viam

**Get every Viam engineer building on Viam**

## Executive Summary

| | |
|---|---|
| **Exec Sponsor** | Shannon (Avery is a key collaborator) |
| **Time Allocation** | 12% (Shannon, and portions of Kristina, Emily, and Avery's time + all engineers) |

## Goals

1. **Team enablement** - Equip teams with the knowledge and resources to build effectively on Viam
2. **Individual & team ownership of the platform** - Foster a culture where every engineer feels ownership over the platform's success
3. **Platform quality** - Improve the platform through direct, hands-on experience building real applications

## Program Structure

### 1. Application Development

6-8 well-defined robotics applications to be developed (from scratch or continued from existing projects):

- Each application will be highly visible
- Together they will demonstrate the depth and breadth of Viam's capabilities
- Initial applications defined up front as prominent examples
- Additional projects solicited via submission template and established guidelines
- Each application has a defined backlog tracked in Jira
- Some backlog items will be documentation

**Requirement:** Every engineer must join an application team.

### 2. Hackathon Kickoff

- **Date:** Mid-February (kickoff Feb 10)
- **Duration:** 3-day hackathon
- **Culmination:** Demos and awards
- **Key collaborators:** Kristina and Emily

### 3. Ongoing Ownership & Accountability

- **Bi-weekly demos** with kudos and backlog burndown celebrations
- **Designated triage sessions** where app teams present their top blockers
- Focus on creating a remarkably positive experience with the platform

### 4. Quarterly Retrospective

- What did our internal building experiences teach us?
- What did we fix because of them?
- What do we need to do to make Viam an exciting and powerful product experience?

### 5. Education

Ad hoc tutorial enablement sessions on:
- Robotics fundamentals
- Use of AI
- Viam platform capabilities
- Emerging best practices

## Scorecard Metrics

### Prior to Kickoff (Feb 10)
- Progress reports on rollout prep
- Defining project backlogs
- Completing builds
- Hackathon logistics prep

### Mar 1 Target
- 70% of individuals have continued their hackathon project

### Ongoing (After Kickoff)
- Team & individual activity in the prior 14 days
- Application backlog items delivered
- Jira issues opened/closed on platform bugs & enhancements emerging from builds

## Open Questions

1. Should consumer/home-automation applications be part of our strategy?
   - How do we incorporate remote engineers?
   - How do we address Viam's scale-to-fleet, fleet maintenance, and batteries-included capabilities?
2. Should we require all engineers to participate in user tests as part of this initiative?
