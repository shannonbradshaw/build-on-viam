# Future Projects

These projects are planned for future Build on Viam phases. They require additional hardware, development time, or infrastructure that isn't available for the current hackathon.

## Projects

| Project | Description | Why Future |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| [Cleaning Cart](future/cleaning-cart.md) | Mobile robot that patrols office collecting dishes and trash | Requires mobile base, office mapping, navigation tuning |
| [Dishwasher](future/dishwasher.md) | Robot that unloads/loads a dishwasher | Requires kitchen installation, mounting infrastructure |
| [Box Bot](future/box-bot.md) | Stationary robot that breaks down cardboard boxes | Requires custom mounting station, permanent installation |

## Common Themes

These projects share characteristics that make them better suited for a future phase:

- **Infrastructure requirements** - Need permanent installation or significant workspace modifications
- **Hardware dependencies** - Require mobile bases or dedicated arm setups not yet available
- **Scope** - Manipulation complexity overlaps with existing Vino/Chess projects

## Bringing Projects to Current Phase

To promote a future project to the current hackathon:

1. Confirm hardware availability and budget
2. Identify project lead and team members
3. Update project file status from "Future" to "New"
4. Move file from `future/` to parent `projects/` directory
5. Add to active projects in README.md
6. Create Jira epic
