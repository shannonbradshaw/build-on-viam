# Project: Retro Roomba Revival

## Overview

**One-line description:** Bring a Roomba 650/655 into the Viam ecosystem with a custom driver module

**Project Lead:** TBD
**Team Members:** TBD
**Status:** New

## Description

Retro Roomba Revival integrates a Roomba 650/655 with Viam by building a custom driver module from scratch. The project implements the Roomba Open Interface protocol over serial, exposes the robot's sensors and actuators through standard Viam component APIs, and demonstrates the full module development lifecycle from prototype to fleet deployment.

No computer vision—just serial communication, bump sensors, and clean abstractions.

## Backlog

### 1. Driver Module

Build the core Viam module that controls the Roomba.

#### 1.1 Module Structure
- [ ] Create module scaffold (main.go, meta.json, resource registration)
- [ ] Implement `base.Base` interface (SetVelocity, SetPower, Stop, IsMoving)

- [ ] Implement `Reconfigure()` for config changes without restart
- [ ] Implement `Close()` for clean shutdown

#### 1.2 Additional Component APIs
- [ ] Implement `sensor.Sensor` for bump sensors
- [ ] Implement `power_sensor.PowerSensor` for battery state
- [ ] Implement `movement_sensor.MovementSensor` for wheel odometry
- [ ] Single config entry creates all Roomba resources

#### 1.3 Roomba Protocol
- [ ] OI initialization (Start, Safe, Full mode commands)
- [ ] Sensor packet parsing (decode binary data)
- [ ] Drive command encoding
- [ ] Error handling (timeouts, reconnection)

#### 1.4 Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for protocol encoding/decoding
- [ ] Mock serial port for module testing
- [ ] Integration tests using Python SDK

---

### 2. Configuration & Fragments

Set up reusable configuration for fleet deployment.

- [ ] Create machine config with Roomba module + components
- [ ] Define attributes schema (serial port, polling rate)
- [ ] Configure frame system for Roomba coordinate frame
- [ ] Extract hardware fragment (Roomba base + sensors)
- [ ] Add fragment variables (serial port, device name)
- [ ] Version the fragment (stable/dev tags)

---

### 3. Application Module

Build robot-side application logic as a Viam module.

- [ ] Create application module (separate from driver module)
- [ ] Implement patrol service (drive patterns, obstacle response)
- [ ] Implement return-to-dock behavior
- [ ] Expose DoCommand for manual activation of behaviors
- [ ] Configure as dependency of driver module

---

### 4. CLI Development

Set up local development workflow against remote hardware.

- [ ] Connect to remote Roomba from laptop via WebRTC
- [ ] Run application module locally during development
- [ ] Iterate without deploying (edit → build → test cycle)
- [ ] Use CLI for manual control and testing
- [ ] Package application module for deployment when ready

---

### 5. Data Pipeline

Configure Viam's built-in data capture and sync.

- [ ] Enable data capture for all sensor components
- [ ] Configure capture frequency per component
- [ ] Set up sync rules (schedule, conditions)
- [ ] View captured data in Viam app
- [ ] Query data via CLI (`viam data` commands)
- [ ] Query data via SDK (DataClient)
- [ ] Analyze battery degradation over time
- [ ] Track patrol efficiency metrics
- [ ] Correlate error patterns (bumps, cliffs, stuck events)

---

### 6. Event-Driven Automation

Configure event-driven behaviors.
