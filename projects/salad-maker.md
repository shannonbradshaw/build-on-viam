# Project: Salad Maker

## Overview

**One-line description:** Dual-arm robot that assembles custom salads from a refrigerated prep station

**Project Lead:** TBD
**Team Members:** TBD
**Status:** New

## Description

Salad Maker is a dual-arm robotic system that assembles salads on demand. Two UFACTORY 850 arms work together to grab ingredients from a refrigerated prep rail using tongs-style grippers, building salads in bowls. Customers order via app or kiosk, selecting from preset recipes or customizing their own combination.

The dual-arm configuration enables parallel ingredient handling and bimanual coordination - one arm can hold the bowl while the other adds ingredients, or both arms can grab different ingredients simultaneously for faster assembly.

This project demonstrates advanced manipulation with dual-arm coordination, vision-based ingredient detection, customer-facing ordering, and real-time order fulfillment.

Arm 1: Place in bowl
Arm 2: Place in bowl
```

**Pattern 2: Hold and Add**
```
Arm 1: Grab bowl from dispenser
Arm 2: Grab ingredient, place in bowl (Arm 1 holds steady)
Arm 2: Grab next ingredient, place in bowl
...
Arm 1: Move bowl to handoff station
```

**Pattern 3: Assembly Line**
```
Arm 1: Handles all ingredients from pans 1-3
Arm 2: Handles all ingredients from pans 4-6
Bowl moves between arms or stays in shared workspace
```

## Notes

**Gap Features This Project Addresses:**
- **Customer Delivery** - Ordering kiosk/app, order status, pickup notification
- **Triggers** - Order received, bowl ready, low ingredient alerts
- **Scheduled Tasks** - Morning prep check, cleaning cycles
- **Data Pipeline** - Portion images, grab success tracking, ML training
- **Multi-machine** - Dual-arm coordination as multi-machine pattern

**Why dual arms:**
- Faster assembly with parallel operations
- One arm can stabilize bowl while other adds ingredients
- Demonstrates advanced multi-machine coordination
- More visually impressive for demos
- Pathway to more complex bimanual tasks

**Gripper considerations:**
- Tongs work well for leafy greens and chunky items
- May need scoop attachment for small items (croutons, nuts)
- Consider food-safe materials (stainless steel, silicone)
- Washable/removable for cleaning

**Food safety notes:**
- Prep station maintains 33-40°F
- Grippers should be food-safe and cleanable
- Consider sneeze guard modifications for robot access
- Staff should handle ingredient restocking
