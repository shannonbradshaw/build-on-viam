# Project: Greenhouse

## Overview

**One-line description:** Automated growing environment with sensing, environmental control, and growth tracking

**Project Lead:** TBD
**Team Members:** TBD
**Status:** New

## Description

Greenhouse is an automated plant growing system that monitors environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light), controls actuators (pumps, lights, fans), and tracks plant growth over time. The system demonstrates Viam's data capture, cloud sync, remote monitoring, and ML capabilities.

This project naturally exercises the full robotics lifecycle - from prototype through fleet deployment - as it can scale from a single plant pod to multiple grow stations with centralized monitoring.

## MVP

Track temperature, humidity, and soil moisture and display on Teleop dashboard in at least one tent. Fan runs when temperature rises above a configurable threshold.

**Stretch:** Automated watering controlled through Viam teleop, on a timer, or triggered by soil moisture.

## Hardware Requirements

| Component | Description | Options |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Sensors | Environmental monitoring | DHT22 (temp/humidity), soil moisture, light sensor, pH |
| Actuators | Environment control | Relay-controlled pump, solenoid, grow lights, fans |
| Camera | Time-lapse & monitoring | USB camera, RPi camera |
| Compute | Main controller | Raspberry Pi 4, Jetson Nano (if ML) |
| Enclosure | Growing environment | IKEA cabinet, grow tent, custom build |
| Growing medium | Plant support | Soil pots, hydroponics, AeroGarden-style |

**Remote-Friendly:** Yes - sensors can be monitored from anywhere, development can be fully remote

## Backlog

Select 3-5 items for post-hackathon development:

### Environmental Control
- [ ] **Multi-zone control** - Different settings for different plant types
- [ ] **Recipe management** - Saved profiles for different crops (via fragments)
- [ ] **Climate scheduling** - Day/night cycles, seasonal adjustments
- [ ] **Fan/ventilation control** - Humidity and temperature regulation

### Vision & ML
- [ ] **Ripeness detection** - ML model detects when produce is ready to harvest
- [ ] **Growth tracking** - Measure plant size/health over time
- [ ] **Pest detection** - Identify pests or disease via vision
- [ ] **Growth time-lapse** - Capture images on schedule, compile into video

### Data & Monitoring
- [ ] **Alerting** - Notify when conditions out of range or harvest ready
- [ ] **Historical analysis** - Track growth rates, correlate with conditions
- [ ] **Yield tracking** - Track harvests over time, optimize for yield
- [ ] **Environmental dashboard** - Rich visualization of all metrics

### Scale & Fleet
- [ ] **Multi-station fleet** - Multiple grow stations with centralized monitoring
- [ ] **Cross-station comparison** - Compare growth across different setups
- [ ] **Centralized recipes** - Push environment profiles to all stations

### Event-Driven Automation (Gap Feature)
- [ ] **Humidity threshold** - When humidity < 40%, activate mister automatically
- [ ] **Temperature threshold** - When temp > 85°F, activate fans and send alert
- [ ] **Soil moisture threshold** - When soil dry, start watering cycle
- [ ] **Light level threshold** - Adjust grow lights based on ambient light sensor

### Data Pipeline / ML Training (Gap Feature)
- [ ] **Automated data capture** - Capture images on schedule for training data
- [ ] **Growth stage labeling** - Label images with growth stage for ML training
- [ ] **Train ripeness model** - Use captured data to train harvest-ready detector
- [ ] **Deploy trained model** - Push updated model to all stations via Registry
- [ ] **Model performance tracking** - Compare model accuracy across versions

### Monitoring & Alerting (Gap Feature)
- [ ] **Threshold alerts** - Configure alerts for out-of-range conditions
- [ ] **Fleet health dashboard** - Single view of all station statuses
- [ ] **Daily digest** - Scheduled summary of all station metrics
- [ ] **Anomaly detection** - Alert on unusual patterns (sensor drift, failures)

## Notes

**Why this project scores highly:**
- Naturally exercises all 5 lifecycle stages (prototype → deploy → scale → fleet → maintain)
- Data capture, cloud sync, remote monitoring are Viam strengths
- Remote-friendly for distributed team members
- Tangible output (actual vegetables/herbs)
- Great content potential (time-lapses, growth data)
- Easy to scale from 1 station to many (fleet demo)

**Gap Features This Project Addresses:**
- **Fleet Management** - Primary demo of multi-machine coordination with 2-3 sensor stations
- **Event-Driven Automation** - Threshold-based automation (humidity, temperature, soil moisture)
- **Data Pipeline** - End-to-end capture → label → train → deploy workflow
- **Monitoring/Alerting** - Environmental alerts and fleet health dashboard
- **Scheduled Tasks** - Periodic sensor readings, daily reports, time-lapse capture
