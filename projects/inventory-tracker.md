# Project: Lab Inventory Tracker

## Overview

**One-line description:** Track lab equipment with zero-tagging vision - just hold up an item and go

**Project Lead:** TBD
**Team Members:** TBD
**Status:** New

## Description

Lab Inventory Tracker solves the "where's the RealSense?" problem without requiring barcodes, RFID tags, or any tagging of objects. The core interaction is simple: hold an item up in front of a camera, and the system captures the moment for tracking.

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
Build: Pi, Webcam, RFID reader, RFID tags per station

Detect hex wrench checkout events and capture photos for audit trail. Checkout stations at both doors to the lab. (We can draw the line under the MVP at any line below.)

Checkout Flow                                                                                                                                                           - User waves object close to checkout station with RFID reader and gets confirmation with a beep
- System captures: tag_id, timestamp, station_id + picture(s)                                                                                                           - Data syncs to Viam cloud                                                                                                                                            --- Item marked as "checked out" in inventory DB                                                                                                                                                                                           
Return Flow                                                                                                                                                             
- User returns item, waves it near RFID reader                                                                                                                          
- RFID reader detects tag at return location                                                                                                                            - Item status updated to “in lab”
- Optionally, capture a picture

Late notice:
Items that have been checked out too long trigger a message in a Slack channel with the item name, picture of person who carried it out and request to return the item

**Phase 2:** Train the system to recognize common lab items from the captured images, automatically identifying WHAT was taken.

**Phase 3:** Add face recognition to identify WHO took the item, enabling fully automatic checkout logging.

This approach is pragmatic - it works on day one with zero training, builds its own training data through normal use, and evolves toward full automation incrementally.

## MVP Options

### Phase 1: Capture the Moment (Recommended MVP)

Detect checkout events and capture photos for audit trail.

**Flow:**
1. Person approaches checkout station
2. Holds item up in front of camera (in designated "checkout zone")
3. System detects the gesture/motion and captures photo
4. Photo saved to cloud with timestamp
5. Notification sent to Slack with image: "Checkout at 10:32am - [photo]"
6. Human review if needed - photo serves as audit trail

**Detection options:**
- Motion detection in designated zone
- "Person holding object" pose detection
- Physical button press (simplest)
- Continuous monitoring with ML detecting checkout gesture

- **Complexity:** Low-Medium
- **Demo Appeal:** Medium-High
- **Scope:** Vision-based detection, data capture, notifications, basic dashboard

### Phase 2: Item Recognition

Add ML to identify WHAT was taken.

- Train model on captured images from Phase 1
- System auto-labels checkout with item name
- "Checkout at 10:32am - Intel RealSense D435 - [photo]"
- Unknown items flagged for manual labeling (feeds training)

- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Demo Appeal:** High
- **Scope:** ML training pipeline, model deployment, item database

### Phase 3: Face Recognition

Add ML to identify WHO took the item.

- Build face database from Phase 1/2 photos (with consent)

- "Shannon checked out Intel RealSense D435 at 10:32am"
- Full automatic checkout - no human review needed

- **Complexity:** Medium-High
- **Demo Appeal:** Very High
- **Scope:** Face recognition model, user database, privacy controls

### Phase 4: Full Automation

Complete hands-free tracking.

- Automatic checkout logging (item + person + time)
- Return detection (item appears back on shelf)
- Overdue reminders sent to the right person
- Usage analytics and trends

**Selected MVP:** Phase 1 - Capture the Moment

## Technical Details

### Checkout Detection

**Approach 1: Motion + Pose Detection**
```
1. Camera monitors checkout zone continuously
2. Motion detected → start analyzing frames
3. Detect "person holding object" pose
4. Capture high-res frame
5. Save + notify
```

**Approach 2: Simple Button**
```
1. Person holds up item
2. Presses physical button
3. Camera captures frame
4. Save + notify
```

**Approach 3: Dwell Time**
```
1. Camera monitors checkout zone
2. Person + object detected in zone
3. If stable for 2 seconds → capture
4. Save + notify
```

Recommendation: Start with Approach 2 (button) for reliability, evolve to Approach 1 or 3.

### Data Schema

```
checkouts:
  - id: string (uuid)
  - timestamp: datetime
  - image_url: string (cloud storage path)
  - item_name: string (nullable - manual or ML)
  - item_confidence: float (nullable - ML confidence)
  - person_name: string (nullable - manual or ML)
  - person_confidence: float (nullable - ML confidence)
  - station_id: string
  - status: enum (pending_review, labeled, auto_labeled)

items:
  - id: string
  - name: string
  - category: string
  - location: string (home station)
  - image_urls: array (reference images for training)

users:
  - id: string
  - name: string
  - email: string
  - team: string
  - face_enrolled: boolean
  - face_embedding: blob (nullable)
```

### Notification Format

**Slack message:**
```
📦 Checkout detected
📍 Hardware Lab Station
🕐 10:32 AM

[Embedded photo of person holding item]

Item: [Unknown - click to label] or [Intel RealSense D435]
Person: [Unknown - click to label] or [Shannon]
```

### ML Pipeline

**Item Recognition:**
1. Export labeled checkout images
2. Crop to item region (manual or detected)
3. Train classifier (transfer learning from ImageNet)
4. Deploy to checkout stations
5. Monitor accuracy, retrain as needed

**Face Recognition:**
1. Collect face images during enrollment (multiple angles)
2. Generate face embeddings (e.g., using face_recognition library)
3. Store embeddings in user database
4. On checkout, extract face → find nearest embedding
5. Apply confidence threshold for match

## Notes

**Why no tagging:**
- Zero friction for users - just hold up and go
- No inventory of tags to manage
- Works with any item immediately
- System improves over time through use

**Gap Features This Project Addresses:**
- **Event-Driven Automation** - Checkout detection, overdue alerts
- **Data Pipeline** - Images → labels → training → deployment
- **Scheduled Tasks** - Daily summaries, weekly reports
- **Customer Delivery** - Dashboard with audit trail

**Privacy Considerations:**
- Face recognition requires explicit opt-in
- Users can view and delete their data
- Option to use system without face recognition (photo audit only)
- Clear signage at checkout stations

**Why this approach is valuable:**
- Works on day one with zero ML training
- Builds its own training data through normal use
- Each phase adds value incrementally
- Solves real problem the team faces
- System will actually be used after hackathon
