# Project: Barista

## Overview

**One-line description:** Single-arm robot that operates an espresso station like a human barista

**Project Lead:** TBD
**Team Members:** TBD
**Status:** New

## Description

Barista is a robotic coffee preparation system where a single UFACTORY 850 arm performs all the steps a human barista would: grabbing the portafilter, holding it under the grinder, placing it on an auto-tamper, locking it into the espresso machine, brewing the shot, steaming milk, and assembling drinks. Customers order via a tablet interface and watch their drink being prepared.

Unlike systems that use fully-automatic espresso machines, this project uses a semi-automatic machine with a robot performing the manipulation. This approach mirrors commercial robotic baristas like [Rozum Cafe](https://cafe.rozum.com/) while demonstrating advanced manipulation skills.

This project combines manipulation complexity (multi-step beverage preparation), customer-facing interaction (ordering interface), and operational features (inventory tracking, scheduling, quality monitoring).

### Key Manipulation Challenges

| Task | Challenge | Solution |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Portafilter lock-in | Requires twist motion under spring pressure | Compliant motion, force feedback |
| Grinder activation | Button press while holding portafilter | Two-stage: position, then press |
| Steam wand positioning | Hold steady during steaming | Fixed wand angle, move pitcher |
| Puck knockback | Firm tap required | Controlled velocity impact |

### Espresso Machine Options

| Machine | Price | Pros | Cons |
|---------|-------|------|------|
| Rancilio Silvia Pro X | ~$1,500 | PID built-in, reliable, common | No API, button control only |
| Gaggia Classic Pro | ~$450 | Cheap, well-documented Pi mods | Needs PID mod for consistency |
| Profitec Go | ~$1,200 | Compact, PID, quality build | No smart features |
| Lelit Anna 2 | ~$500 | PID, compact | Limited community support |

**Recommendation:** Rancilio Silvia Pro X - reliable, PID temperature control built-in, robot just needs to press buttons.

## Notes

**Why single arm works:**
- Sequential workflow is natural for coffee making
- One arm is sufficient for all manipulation tasks
- Simpler development, lower cost
- Commercial systems (Cafe X) use single arm successfully

**Why Puqpress instead of robot tamping:**
- UFACTORY 850 payload (5kg/11lb) < required tamp force (30lb)
- Auto-tamper ensures consistent pressure
- This is what commercial robotic baristas do
- Robot still does all other manipulation

**Gap Features This Project Addresses:**
- **Customer Delivery** - Ordering interface with TypeScript/Flutter SDKs
- **Triggers** - Order received, brew complete, inventory alerts
- **Scheduled Tasks** - Morning warmup, cleaning cycles
- **Monitoring/Alerting** - Bean level, water, temperature, usage
- **Data Pipeline** - Drink quality images, shot timing data

**Risk Factors:**
- Portafilter lock-in requires precise force control
- Steam wand manipulation is complex
- Hot liquids require safety considerations
- Espresso quality depends on many variables
