# Build on Viam: Hackathon Announcement + Updated 20% Time Program

Hi everyone,

As mentioned at the recent all-hands, we're launching **Build on Viam** — a program where we become our own best customers by building real robotics applications on the Viam platform.

Deep platform familiarity isn't optional — it's what enables us to work faster and more effectively. Every hour spent navigating unfamiliar parts of the platform, debugging issues we could have anticipated, or going down dead-end paths is time we're not shipping new features or user experience improvements. This program is an investment that pays back in velocity: engineers who deeply understand Viam make better decisions, move faster, and build better products.

## The Projects

The program is built around a set of well-defined robotics applications that we'll develop over the coming months, starting with a hackathon kickoff. Each project has clear goals, exercises key Viam capabilities, and has a well-defined backlog that extends beyond the hackathon. We welcome additional project proposals — links to browse projects and submit proposals are below.

## What's changing with 20% time?

We're adding more structure and support. Every engineer will join a project team for the quarter, dedicating at least 4 hours per week. We'll kick off with a 3-day hackathon, followed by bi-weekly demos and regular syncs throughout the quarter. Enablement sessions on using AI more effectively, robotics fundamentals, platform capabilities, and best practices will be available as needed.

## Hackathon Kickoff: February 24-26

We're kicking off the program with a hackathon!

| Day | Schedule |
|-----|----------|
| **Feb 24** | 9am Breakfast, 10am Kickoff, 11am-12pm Exec Office Hours, 12:30pm Lunch, 2-4pm Exec Office Hours |
| **Feb 25** | 9am Breakfast, 10-11am Exec Office Hours, 12pm Lunch, 2-4pm Exec Office Hours |
| **Feb 26** | 9am Breakfast, 10am-12:30pm Exec Office Hours, 12:30pm Lunch, 1-3pm Final Touches, 4pm Presentations to Judges |

Remote employees can participate virtually. The **Greenhouse** and **Retro Roomba** projects are specifically designed to be remote-friendly.

## Key Dates

- **Feb 6** — Deadline to submit new project proposals
- **Feb 13** — Deadline to join a project team
- **Week of Feb 16** — Pre-hackathon meetings to finalize MVP strategy and enablement needs
- **Feb 24-26** — Hackathon

We welcome additional project ideas! To propose a new project, follow the template in the repo and submit a pull request.

Hardware will be assembled and machines will be connected to Viam before the hackathon — you won't need to build hardware from scratch. If there's high interest in a particular project, we'll break it into multiple teams.

## A Note on Expectations

Knowing the Viam platform is a core expectation of performance at Viam. As part of our performance expectations, every engineer is to actively use, explore, and deepen their understanding of the platform. The upcoming hackathon will kick-start this focus, but ongoing hands-on usage and continuous learning are required, not optional, to be effective in our roles and to execute well as a company. These expectations will be formally reflected in the engineering career ladder in the coming weeks.

Looking forward to building together!

Shannon
