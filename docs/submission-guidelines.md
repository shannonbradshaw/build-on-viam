# Project Submission Guidelines

**Submission Deadline: February 13**

## Overview

We're looking for ambitious robot application ideas that will make impressive, visible demonstrations of Viam's capabilities while providing meaningful learning opportunities for everyone involved. Up to 8 projects will be selected for the Build on Viam program.

This is your chance to propose a project you'd love to see in our lab—something that makes visitors say "wow" and teaches our team what it really feels like to build on Viam.

## Who Can Submit

Any Viam engineer can propose a project. You don't need to lead or even join a project you propose—though you're welcome to. Great ideas can come from anywhere.

## What We're Looking For

The best proposals:

1. **Demonstrate Viam's value** - Showcase multiple Viam capabilities working together
2. **Create visible impact** - Make compelling demos that impress visitors, customers, and executives
3. **Enable learning** - Give engineers hands-on experience with the platform
4. **Are achievable** - Have a realistic MVP that can be completed during the hackathon, with meaningful stretch goals

### Feature Coverage Priorities

Review the [Project Planning Guide](project-planning-guide.md) to see which Viam capabilities need better coverage. Projects that demonstrate these gap features are especially valuable:

- **Triggers** - Event-driven automation (sensor thresholds, detections)
- **Scheduled Tasks** - Periodic operations
- **Data Pipeline** - Capture → Label → Train → Deploy workflow
- **Customer Delivery** - Guest-facing interfaces with SDKs
- **Fleet Management** - Multi-machine deployment
- **Monitoring & Alerting** - Operational visibility

## Submission Process

### 1. Prepare Your Proposal

Use the [project template](../templates/project-template.md) to document your idea. Your proposal must include:

- **Clear project description** - What does it do? Why is it compelling?
- **Viam capabilities demonstrated** - Which features does it showcase?
- **Hardware requirements** - What's needed? Is it available?
- **MVP scope** - What can be completed during the 3-day hackathon?
- **Post-hackathon backlog** - What comes next?

### 2. Review Supporting Documents

Before submitting, review:

- [Project Assessment Criteria](project-assessment-criteria.md) - How proposals are evaluated
- [Project Planning Guide](project-planning-guide.md) - Feature coverage and strategic thinking
- [Best Practices](best-practices.md) - Guidelines for building on Viam

### 3. Submit for Review

1. Create a new file in the `projects/` directory using the template
2. Name your file: `[project-name].md` (lowercase, hyphens for spaces)
3. Submit a PR to this repository
4. Tag Shannon and Avery for review

## Evaluation Criteria

A leadership team will evaluate submissions based on:

| Criterion | Weight | What We're Looking For |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| **Platform Coverage** | High | Demonstrates meaningful Viam capabilities, especially gap features |
| **Feasibility** | High | MVP achievable in 3 days; backlog is realistic |
| **Demo Appeal** | High | Compelling to watch; clear "wow" moment |
| **Learning Value** | Medium | Engineers will gain valuable platform experience |
| **Resource Requirements** | Medium | Hardware is available or obtainable; remote development possible |

See [Project Assessment Criteria](project-assessment-criteria.md) for the complete scoring rubric.

## Selection Process

- Up to **8 projects** will be selected for the program
- Some current projects may be replaced if a better proposal emerges
- Proposals not selected this round will be reconsidered for future rounds
- Feedback provided on all submissions

## Project Requirements

### Must Have

- **Showcases Viam value** - Demonstrates at least 2-3 Viam capabilities meaningfully
- **Scoped MVP** - A working demo achievable in 3 days of focused effort
- **Defined backlog** - Clear post-hackathon work items
- **Documentation commitment** - Plan to document the build process

### Encouraged

- Projects that address capability gaps (Triggers, Fleet, Data Pipeline, etc.)
- Projects with fleet potential (naturally extends to multiple machines)
- Projects that exercise the full lifecycle (prototype → deploy → scale → maintain)
- Remote-friendly development (can be worked on without physical presence)
- Customer or marketing visibility potential

### Avoid

- Projects that only use Viam for trivial functionality
- Scope so large that MVP is unrealistic
- Projects requiring unavailable or very expensive hardware
- Ideas that duplicate existing projects without adding significant value

## Tips for Strong Proposals

1. **Be ambitious, but realistic** - We want projects that push boundaries while being achievable with effort
2. **Think about the demo** - What will visitors see? What's the "wow" moment?
3. **Consider the learning** - What will engineers learn by building this?
4. **Address gap features naturally** - Don't force features; pick a project where they fit
5. **Plan for continuation** - The hackathon is just the start; what's the 3-month vision?

## Example Strong Proposal Elements

**Strong:** "Robotic coffee station that takes orders via tablet, prepares espresso drinks, and tracks inventory levels with automated alerts"
- Multiple capabilities: arm control, triggers, customer delivery, monitoring
- High demo appeal: everyone loves watching a robot make coffee
- Natural fleet extension: multiple office locations
- Clear learning opportunity: manipulation, customer interfaces, operational features

**Weaker:** "Robot that turns on a light when motion is detected"
- Limited capabilities demonstrated
- Low demo appeal
- Limited learning opportunity
